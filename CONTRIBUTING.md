## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the project. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Check the [open issues](https://github.com/lectra-official/ld-react-feature-flags/issues/) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

## Pull Request Process

The core team will be monitoring for pull requests. When we get one, we'll need to get another person to sign off on the changes and then merge the pull request. We'll do our best to provide updates and feedback throughout the process.

_Before_ submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. A guide on how to fork a repository: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

    Open terminal (e.g. Terminal, iTerm, Git Bash or Git Shell) and type:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/ld-react-feature-flags
    cd ld-react-feature-flagsst
    git checkout -b my_branch
    ```

    Note: Replace `<your_username>` with your GitHub username

3.  Run `npm install`<br />

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. You can use watch mode that continuously transforms changed files to make your life easier.

    ```sh
    # in the background
    npm run test:watch
    ```

5.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.

6.  Ensure the test suite passes via `npm run test`. 

    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```
